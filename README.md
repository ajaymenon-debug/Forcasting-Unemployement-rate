# Forcasting-Unemployement-rate
Forcasting the unemployment rate as a result of COVID 19

I have considered 5 different algorithms for forcasting :
1. K nearest neighbors
2. LinearRegression
3. RandomForestRegressor
4. SVR
5. XGBRegressor

Packages to be installed inside the notebook:

Run these following code in notebook.
!pip install seaborn

!pip install xgboost
